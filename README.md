## Pulsometer
This proyect consist in building a clock heart rate monitor with Attiny85 in a Flexible solder board. Using a MAX30102 sensor to catch the Heart rates and a SSD1306 128x64 OLED display. This should **not be used for medical purposes**.
The project is an a challengue in software  hardware and soldering .

## Software
